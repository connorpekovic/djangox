<div class="container" style="font-size: 18px;" >
    <p class="pt-5" style="color: white;"> This project is to serve as the perfect example as to how to make a
        highly secure database driven web app.</p>
        
    <p class="pt-1" style="color: white;">We use state of the art web technology called the 
        Python Django Web Application Framework that runs in a low-cost, highly secure container.

        This website implimentes all the fundamental functions of <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factor</a>
        web development; containerization, consuming JSON data with REST Api's, data visualization, and forms to interact with data.
        The codebase is small, readable, and well commented to 
        serve as a perfect example for future web projects for myself and anyone open internet. The code base will be forever available
        <a href= " https://github.com/connorpekovic/djangox">here</a> on GitHub.</p>

    <p class="pt-1" style="color: white;">Future plans for this website include enriching the data provided in return for a location. This project will
        be used as an example for future tutorials.
