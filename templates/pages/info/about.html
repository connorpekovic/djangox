        <p> This project is here to serve as the perfect example as to how to make a
            highly secure database driven web app. The source code is on <a href=" https://github.com/connorpekovic/djangox">GitHub</a>. 
            This domain is for sale.</p>
            
        <p class="pt-1" >We use state of the art web technology called the 
            Python Django Web Application Framework that runs in a low-cost, highly secure container.
    
            This website implimentes all the fundamental functions of <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factor</a>
            web development; containerization, consuming JSON data with REST Api's, data visualization, and forms to interact with data.
            The codebase is small, readable, and well commented to 
            serve as a perfect example for future web projects for myself and anyone on the open internet. The code base will be forever available
            <a href= "https://github.com/connorpekovic/djangox">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
    
        <p class="pt-1" >Future plans for this website include enriching the data provided in return for a location. This project will
            be used as an example for future tutorials.
